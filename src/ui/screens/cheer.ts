/**
 * The beat between the last move and the results panel.
 *
 * A run used to end straight into a panel of numbers, which reads as being
 * marked rather than as having finished something. It ends in two beats now.
 * First the board dims and says what happened and what it was worth, in one
 * big number, for a few seconds. Then a word lands and a character dances,
 * holding on the last frame until the player taps — so the moment ends when
 * they are done with it rather than on a timer.
 *
 * The clips are optional. With `CHEER_CLIPS` empty the word carries the moment
 * on its own and holds for `WORD_ONLY_MS`, so the game never waits on an asset
 * to look right. See docs/CONTENT.md for what to hand over.
